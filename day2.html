                <p> Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.[9] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change. This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[10] It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.[10]Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM.
